<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    We have finished our login screen, now it is time to start
    navigating somewhere else since our app is not just about logging into it.
</p>
<p>
    We will start by creating a screen for students to check the current state of
    their grades.
</p>
<p>
    This information will be on our backend service and we will use the jwt token
    we received from our backend to be able to retrieve the data that we will
    be presenting on the screen for students.
</p>
<p>
    In the end what students really care about is their final grade. Our backend, with
    good reasons (database normalization), only store the grades for each test
    and possibly an recovery exam grade.
    Our app will be responsible for doing some calculations to know the final grade.
    Besides that there are some conditions for passing without doing exam, failing directly without
    exam or being able to do the exam.
</p>
<p>
    This screen is for students only so only users with role STUDENT should be navigating
    into it. For the moment teachers won't do anything else besides what is already implemented,
    which is toasting a message for a valid login.
</p>
<p>
    You will notice that we will require some edit text where a text view would be fine and the
    reason is because we have plans to implement more features on this screen in a later moment
    which will make that make some sense (hopefully at least).
