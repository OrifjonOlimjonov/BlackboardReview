<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    On this stage we will create the teacher section of the application.
</p>

<p>
    This section will contain two different screens.
    One that will contain a list of student names and
    to which teachers will navigate to just after
    a successful login.
    Another that teachers will navigate to after clicking
    on one of the student names, which will have almost the
    same structure as the student screen, but will have
    one extra button to submit data and all edit text will be
    editable so that the teacher can assign or revise grades
    for their students.
    The logic behind the screen will be different, like for example
    final grades will always be calculated on this screen and pending
    grades will be displayed with -1.
</p>

<p>
    The suggested implementation will be to make a component that contains all
    the views that are included in <code>fragment_student</code> so that you can
    reuse those to make the <code>fragment_teacher_student_detail</code>
    using the merge and include tags just adding the extra button that is not shared
    by both screens on the teacher section.
</p>

<p>
    The contents of the list with student names will be retrieved by making a GET request to
    the endpoint <code>/teacher/student</code>.
    The student data will be retrieved by making a GET request to the endpoint
    <code>/teacher/student/[name]</code>, where [name] is a placeholder for a student name.
    The student data will be updated by making a PATCH request to the same endpoint
    <code>/teacher/student/[name]</code>
