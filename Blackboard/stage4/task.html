<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    On this stage we will create the teacher section of the application.
</p>

<p>
    This section will contain two different screens.
    One that will contain a list of student names and
    to which teachers will navigate to just after
    a successful login.
    Another that teachers will navigate to after clicking
    on one of the student names, which will have almost the
    same structure as the student screen, but will have
    one extra button to submit data and all edit text will be
    editable so that the teacher can assign or revise grades
    for their students.
    The logic behind the screen will be different, like for example
    final grades will always be calculated on this screen and pending
    grades will be displayed with -1.
</p>

<p>
    The suggested implementation will be to make a component that contains all
    the views that are included in <code>fragment_student</code> so that you can
    reuse those to make the <code>fragment_teacher_student_detail</code>
    using the merge and include tags just adding the extra button that is not shared
    by both screens on the teacher section.
</p>

<p>
    The contents of the list with student names will be retrieved by making a GET request to
    the endpoint <code>/teacher/student</code>.
    The student data will be retrieved by making a GET request to the endpoint
    <code>/teacher/student/[name]</code>, where [name] is a placeholder for a student name.
    The student data will be updated by making a PATCH request to the same endpoint
    <code>/teacher/student/[name]</code>
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>



    <li>
        After a successful login of a user with role <code>TEACHER</code>
        navigate to <code>TeacherFragment</code> which is described bellow.
        Only teachers should be allowed to navigate to that screen.
    </li>

    <li>
        Make a GET request to retrieve student names
        on <code>/teacher/student</code> endpoint
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the jwt token received from login reponse
                on this request's Authorization header using the format
                <code>"Bearer [token]"</code> where [token]
                is a placeholder
            </li>
            <li>
                If the the response has code 200 receive the payload
                which will be on a json containing key <code>students</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The value for <code>students</code> is a list of student names
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will assume that the server response is always with valid format.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If the response code is not 200 treat it as a network error.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Create a fragment <code>TeacherFragment</code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Include <code>blackboard_title</code>.
                Use it to display network error messages
                in a similar way to the way used on login screen
            </li>

            <li>
                Add a <code>RecyclerView</code> with id
                <code>teacher_students_list_rv</code>, use the
                linear layout manager and set the orientation to
                vertical
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Create a list_item_student layout
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a <code>TextView</code> with id
                        <code>list_item_student_name_tv</code>.
                        The text should be set with student names.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the students list,
                        that was received as response
                        from <code>/teacher/student</code> endpoint,
                        as values for <code>list_item_student_name_tv</code>.
                        The order of the items displayed should
                        match the received list order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a list item from <code>list_item_student_name_tv</code>
                        is clicked navigate to <code>TeacherStudentFragment</code>,
                        which is described bellow
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Make a GET request to retrieve student grades
        on <code>teacher/student/[studentName]</code> endpoint
        where [studentName] is a placeholder for the student name
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the jwt token received from login reponse
                on this request's Authorization header using the format
                <code>"Bearer [token]"</code> where [token]
                is a placeholder
            </li>
            <li>
                If the the response has code 200 receive the payload
                which will be on a json containing keys <code>name</code>, <code>grades</code>
                and <code>exam</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The value for <code>name</code> is a string with the student name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The value for <code>grades</code> is a list of integers from -1 up to 100,
                        both inclusive, that denotes the value of a test grade.
                        Grades 0 up to 100 are valid test grades
                        that were already assigned by the teacher
                        and the number -1 indicates that the test grade was not yet assigned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The value for <code>exam</code> is one integer from -1 up to 100,
                        both inclusive, that denotes the value of an recovery exam grade.
                        Also like grades an exam value of -1 indicates that this grade was not
                        yet assigned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will assume that the server response is always with valid format.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If the response code is not 200 treat it as a network error.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Make the student details a reusable layout
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a new layout xml file and place
                all the views with ids that are currently present at
                <code>fragment_student</code> in it.
                Namely
                <code>blackboard_title</code>,
                <code>student_name_tv</code>,
                <code>student_grades_label</code>,
                <code>student_grades_rv</code>,
                <code>student_partial_result_tv</code>,
                <code>student_exam_label</code>,
                <code>student_exam_et</code>,
                <code>student_final_result_tv</code>,
                should all be included in this new component.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the include tag to include the new layout
                wherever it needs to be included, like <code>fragment_student</code>
                for example.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are using view binding you will need to make some adjustments
                to the binding routine.
                Use something like this:
                <pre><code>
binding = FragmentStudentBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
studentDetailBinding = StudentDetailBinding.bind(binding.root)
titleBinding = BlackboardTitleBinding.bind(studentDetailBinding.root)
                </code></pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Create a fragment <code>TeacherStudentDetailsFragment</code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Include the reusable layout with student details just created above.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the already included <code>TextView</code> with id
                <code>student_name_tv</code>,
                the text should match the student name received as
                response to the GET request on
                <code>teacher/student/[studentName]</code> endpoint
            </li>
            <li>
                On the already included <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_grades_label</code>
                set the text property with
                <code>"Grades:"</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                On the already included <code>RecyclerView</code> with id
                <code>student_grades_rv</code>, use the
                linear layout manager and set the orientation to
                horizontal
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Keep using list_item_grade layout for list items
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <code>TextView</code> with id
                        <code>grade_header_tv</code> should have same
                        behaviour as it was on <code>StudentFragment</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On <code>EditText</code> with id
                        <code>grade_value_et</code>
                        <ul>
                            <li>keep the inputType number.</li>
                            <li>
                                The text should be set with a grade from the list of
                                grades.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                All grades should be displayed as received
                                on response to the GET request on
                                <code>teacher/student/[studentName]</code> endpoint.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The order of the items displayed should
                                match the received list order.
                            </li>
                            <li>All <code>grade_value_et</code> should be enabled.</li>
                            <li>
                                Limit user input into the range -1..100 including both
                                ends. If user input is lower than the range replace the input
                                with -1. If the user input is greater than the range replace
                                the input with 100.

                Calculate the partial result
                <ul>
                    <li>the partial result is the simple arithmetic average from test grades
                        <code>((total sum of test grades) / (total num of test grades))</code>

                    <li>
                        negative values should not be summed up on the total, but the total num of test grades still count that test
                        for example: <code>grades = [100, -1, 100, -1] -> partial result = 200 / 4 = 50</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>the partial result will be displayed in a <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_partial_result_tv</code></li>
