<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    We said on last stage that we would be making our authentication scheme using a
    backend service that we communicate with though network requests.
    Now is the time we will do it.
</p>
<p>
    To make network communication we are going to use OkHttp and to assist with serialization
    and deserialization we have included Moshi. Tests do not test serialization so you may
    prefer to use some other library that you choose to include, or handle it yourself,
    but tests will expect the use of OkHttp and have only been
    tested to work with OkHttp being used directly.
</p>
<p>
    When applications start using complex objects like network clients a common pattern used
    to organize the instantiation and access to those instances is dependency injection.
    We will recommend the use of the Application class to make a manual dependency injection
    pattern.
    Tests will not test this, so other solutions might work, but avoid using mutation on
    "static variables", which is anything that transpiles to a java static variable, as
    this may cause state leak between different tests and may result on incorrect test behaviour.
    This warning on mutating static variables is valid for all projects and stages of this track.
</p>

<p>
    Using internet requires permission, but it is a simple authorization that don't require
    requesting permission at runtime. A simple declaration on manifest file is enough.
</p>

<p>
    You most certainly will want to make manual tests to your application to see if you are
    doing things right, but how will you be able to test network requests?
    You could do the hard way and create a backend all yourself just for the purpose of
    testing your application.
    But we know that besides being a lot of work there would also be no guarantees your backend
    would be compliant with what is expected from it. To address this issue we are recommending
    the use of Mockoon application, which can be downloaded <a href="https://mockoon.com/">here</a>.
    Mockoon creates a mock backend server and all the configuration of this backend will live in a
    json file that can be shared and loaded elsewhere.
    We have included a <code>Blackboard.json</code>, placed at the same level as the manifest file,
    that can be loaded on Mockoon so you will be able to have a mock backend to test your application.
    You may want to experiment changing the config of this backend, which is great, but we recommend cloning
    the server before doing that so that you will still have the original in case you want to go back.
    There are some limitations to Mockoon and for a very complex backend it may not be the best tool,
    but this should be enough for our use case.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Add permission for internet on manifest file. Also on manifest file
        add this code on application tag
        to be able to communicate with http
        <code>android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a class that extends the Application class,
        use this class to instantiate and host your network client.
        Declare your application class on manifest file.
        You can find the application instance through an activity.
        You will then be able to cast to your specific class that extends
        the Application class and reach the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        set the baseUrl
        <ul>
            <li>tests may pass the baseUrl through intent.extras with the key <code>"baseUrl"</code>.
                That will be the baseUrl for the testing server.
            </li>
            <li>
                if test has not passed baseUrl use a default
                that is convenient for you to do manual testing
            </li>
            <li>
                there is a special address to access your computer
                localhost from the device you are using, which is
                http://10.0.2.2:xxxx/, where xxxx is the port number.
                So if you set your baseUrl to http://10.0.2.2:3001/ you
                will reach port 3001 on your localhost.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        set up Mockoon for manual testing
        <ul>
            <li>
                install Mockoon from the official site
                <a href="https://mockoon.com/">https://mockoon.com/</a></li>
            <li>
                with Mockoon open go to 'file -> open environment'. On the file
                dialog look for Blackboard.json that lives on the same folder
                as the manifest file.
            </li>
            <li>
                An server with name Blackboard and port number 3001 should be showing
                up on Mockoon, right click on it to make duplicate so that you can have
                a fallback copy
            </li>
            <li>
                set your default baseUrl of your application
                to the port number of the server you are using
            </li>
            <li>
                click the green arrow to run the mock server and be able to serve requests
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make HTTP requests to validate login
        <ul>
            <li>
                Send a POST request to <code>/login</code> endpoint
                with a json payload that contains keys <code>username</code> and <code>pass</code>
                whose values are: 
                For username, the input that was given on 
                <code>login_username_et</code>
                For pass, the input that was given on <code>login_pass_et</code> after
                going through the encryption scheme that was already 
                being used on previous stage.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user is authorized the response will have code 200. Receive the payload
                which will on be a json containing keys <code>username</code>
                <code>token</code> and <code>role</code>. 
                Token is a jwt token that will be used on requests on further stages. Role
                is the role associated with username and username is the same as the one in
                request
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user is not authorized the response will have code 401. That is
                a login error that should be handled the same way as already done, setting
                login_username_et error to <code>"Invalid Login"</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        use <code>blackboard_title</code> error property do display network error
        <ul>
            <li>
                In case you don't receive a 200 nor a 401 response or if the call fails
                display a network error by displaying an error message on
                <code>blackboard_title</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                To be able to display error messages on a TextView
                we have to set it as focusable.
                On layout set <code>android:focusable="true"</code> and
                <code>android:focusableInTouchMode="true"</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                To display the error message
                set <code>blackboardTitle.error</code> with the message
                received on the response and also request focus to
                <code>blackboard_title</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
