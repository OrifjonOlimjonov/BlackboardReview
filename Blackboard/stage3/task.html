<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    We have finished our login screen, now it is time to start
    navigating somewhere else since our app is not just about logging into it.
</p>
<p>
    We will start by creating a screen for students to check the current state of
    their grades.
</p>
<p>
    This information will be on our backend service and we will use the jwt token
    we received from our backend to be able to retrieve the data that we will
    be presenting on the screen for students.
</p>
<p>
    In the end what students really care about is their final grade. Our backend, with
    good reasons (database normalization), only store the grades for each test
    and possibly a recovery exam grade.
    Our app will be responsible for doing some calculations to know the final grade.
    Besides that there are some conditions for passing without doing exam, failing directly without
    exam or being able to do the exam.
</p>
<p>
    This screen is for students only so only users with role STUDENT should be navigating
    into it. For the moment teachers won't do anything else besides what is already implemented,
    which is toasting a message for a valid login.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Make the title a "reusable component"
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a new layout xml file and place
                the view with id <code>blackboard_title</code> in it
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the include tag to include <code>blackboard_title</code>
                wherever it needs to be included, like <code>fragment_login</code>
                for example.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are using view binding you will need to make some adjustments
                to the binding routine.
                Use something like this:
                <pre><code>
loginBinding = FragmentLoginBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
titleBinding = BlackboardTitleBinding.bind(loginBinding.root)
                </code></pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Make a GET request to retrieve student grades
        on <code>/student/[username]</code> endpoint
        where [username] is a placeholder for the username
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the jwt token received from login reponse
                on this request's Authorization header using the format
                <code>"Bearer [token]"</code> where [token]
                is a placeholder
            </li>
            <li>
                If the the response has code 200 receive the payload
                which will be on a json containing keys <code>grades</code>
                and <code>exam</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The value for <code>grades</code> is a list of integers from -1 up to 100,
                        both inclusive, that denotes the value of a test grade.
                        Grades 0 up to 100 are valid test grades
                        that were already assigned by the teacher
                        and the number -1 indicates that the test grade was not yet assigned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The value for <code>exam</code> is one integer from -1 up to 100,
                        both inclusive, that denotes the value of an recovery exam grade.
                        Also like grades an exam value of -1 indicates that this grade was not
                        yet assigned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will assume that the server response is always with valid format.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If the response code is not 200 treat it as a network error.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a fragment <code>StudentFragment</code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Include <code>blackboard_title</code>.
                Use it to display network error messages
                in a similar way to the way used on login screen
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <code>TextView</code> with id
                <code>student_name_tv</code>.
                The text should match the username
                from login response
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_grades_label</code>
                set the text property with
                <code>"Grades:"</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <code>RecyclerView</code> with id
                <code>student_grades_rv</code>, use the
                linear layout manager and set the orientation to
                horizontal
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Create a list_item_grade layout
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a <code>TextView</code> with id
                        <code>grade_header_tv</code>.
                        The text should be set with <code>"T:[x]"</code>
                        where [x] is a placeholder for an integer that is
                        the list item position considering the first element
                        as position one (one-indexed)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a <code>EditText</code> with id
                        <code>grade_value_et</code> and inputType number.
                        The text should be set with a grade from the list of
                        grades.
                        In case of a grade with -1 value display:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If exam is also -1 then the grade value
                                is considered pending and you should
                                display an empty string
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If exam is not -1 then the grade value
                                is zeroed and not pending, in which
                                case you should display the value
                                0
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        For this stage we won't be implementing any editing on this widget
                        so you can disable it if you want to although tests will not enforce this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the grades list,
                        that was received as response
                        from calling /student/{username},
                        as values for grade_value_et.
                        The order of the items displayed should
                        match the received list order.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculate the partial result
                <ul>
                    <li>the partial result is the simple arithmetic average from test grades
                        <code>((total sum of test grades) / (total num of test grades))</code>
                        using integer division
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        negative values should not be summed up on the total, but the total num of test grades still count that test
                        for example: <code>grades = [100, -1, 100, -1] -> partial result = 200 / 4 = 50</code>
                        </li>
                    <li>the partial result will be displayed in a <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_partial_result_tv</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_partial_result_tv</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>set the text property with
                        <code>Partial Result: [partial result]</code>
                        where [partial result] is a placeholder for the partial result
                        calculation that was required just above
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_exam_label</code>
                set the text property with
                <code>"Exam:"</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <code>EditText</code> with id <code>student_exam_et</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        students are allowed to take the exam
                        even if the grade for exam is not going
                        to be considered for the final grade,
                        for which reason you should display the
                        exam if there is one in the response
                        obtained from <code>/student/{username}</code>
                        endpoint
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If exam is -1 then the value
                        is considered pending only if the exam is possible.
                        Anyway, being possible or not, you should display an empty string when
                        the exam value is -1.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculate the final result
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the final result is considered pending if there are still any pending
                        grades or exam
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if the exam is not possible you should discard the grade for
                        exam even if there is one and the final grade should be equal to the partial grade
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if the partial grade is below 30 the student will fail directly without exam
                        and thus the exam is considered not possible
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if the partial grade is equal or above 70 the student will pass directly without exam
                        and thus the exam is also considered not possible
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if the exam is possible the final grade should be the
                        simple arithmetic average between partial grade and exam grade
                        using integer division
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the exam is possible if the partial grade is above or equal to 30 and below 70
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the final grade should be displayed on a
                        <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_final_result_tv</code>
                        only if the final result is not considered pending
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <code>TextView</code> with id <code>student_final_result_tv</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>set the text property with
                        <code>Final Result: [final result]</code>
                        where [final result] is a placeholder for the final result

                    <li>
                        if the final result is pending replace the placeholder with an empty string
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
