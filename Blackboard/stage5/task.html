<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    On this stage we will add a feature on students section so that they can make
    predictions on their grades and have predictions for their partial and final grades
    so that they can plan better their semester/year.
</p>

<p>
    To distinguish real results from prediction results a simple heuristic
    of placing predictions inside parentheses next to the real result will
    be adopted. This will make possible to keep using the same layout
    while still giving a visual cue on the semantic of the screen content
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        All below objectives are related to student section
    </li>
    <li>
        If a grade or exam is not pending disable the related edit text so
        that students cannot make predictions on grades that were
        already assigned
    </li>
    <li>
        If a grade or exam is pending enable the related edit text so
        that students can make prediction on the grades
        that are still pending
    </li>
    <li>
        Calculate the partial result for the predictions
        <ul>
            <li>
                Same calculation rules applies for partial result
                predictions as for the partial result real grades,
                but real grades only take into account grades that are not pending
                while predictions take into account student input
                on enabled edit text as well
            </li>
            <li>
                Empty edit text should be counted as zero while
                calculating the predictions
            </li>
            <li>
                Making a prediction for exam grade does not change
                the pending status of other grades.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Display the prediction partial result only if it is different
        than the real partial result
        <ul>
            <li>
                the prediction partial result should be displayed
                on the already existing <code>student_partial_result_tv</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                use the following format to display both the real and the prediction
                partial result together.
                <code>"Partial Result: [partialGrade] ([partialPredictionGrade])"</code>
                where [partialGrade] is a placeholder for the real partial grade and
                [partialPredictionGrade] is a placeholder
                for the prediction partial grade
            </li>
            <li>
                if the prediction and the partial are equal use the following format
                <code>"Partial Result: [partialGrade]"</code>.
                Do not add extra spaces after [partialGrade]
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Calculate the final result for the predictions
        <ul>
            <li>
                same calculation rules applies for final result
                predictions as for the final result real grades,
                but real grades only take into account grades that are not pending
                while predictions take into account student input
                on enabled edit text as well.
                Prediction for final grades should still take into account
                if the exam is possible or not.
            </li>

            <li>
                empty edit text should be counted as zero while
                calculating the predictions
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Display the prediction final result only if it is different
        than the real final result
        <ul>
            <li>
                The prediction final result should be displayed
                on the already existing <code>student_final_result_tv</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the following format to display the prediction
                final result.
                <code>"Final Result:  ([finalPredictionGrade])"</code>
                [finalPredictionGrade] is a placeholder
                for the prediction final grade. Notice that there are two spaces
                before the opening parentheses.
                The extra space is denoting the missing real grade.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the prediction and the partial are equal use the following format
                <code>"Final Result: [finalGrade]"</code>.
                if the final grade still pending [finalGrade] should still be replaced
                by an empty string.
                Notice there is no following space after [finalGrade], but one space before it
            </li>
            <li>
                Logically it should not be possible for displaying both prediction
                and the real grade for the final result. That is because
                if the final result should be displayed then
                there is no pending grades to make predictions for.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
